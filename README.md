## Changelog

### [1.0.0] - 14/07/2026

#### Added
- Integrated a live database-backed global visitor counter component driven by CountAPI cloud infrastructure.
- Added a fail-safe client-side fallback mechanism using `localStorage` to ensure the layout remains functional even when browsing offline.
- Implemented **MCMM Constraints** (Multi-Corner Multi-Mode) structural links to the primary navigation logic.
- Implemented an immersive, cyberpunk hardware engineering console popup window overlay that triggers on every fresh page initialization and browser reload event.
- Added a highly visible, lightweight backdrop overlay blur effect (`backdrop-filter: blur(4px)`) featuring a precisely tuned 20% opacity tint mask to ensure the background website remains distinctly visible behind the active modal layout frame.
- Added a strict single-line text layout with decorative cyber bullet markers (`■`) to anchor primary informational site statements without structural breaks.
- Created a dynamic, infinite CSS monospaced typewriter effect loop (`typeLetterByLetterContinuous`) that slowly types out terminal text from left to right at an authentic hardware reading pace before cleanly resetting.
- Integrated hardware-inspired metadata frame elements like the `[ SYS_READY ]` console tracker text flag to establish an authentic ASIC design testing dashboard environment.
- Implemented an isolated 3-row CSS Grid layout engine on the emblem links (`.emblem-footer-link`) to cleanly separate text content from structural image containers.
- Introduced ambient wireframe tracking visibility to the HUD bounding target vector corners (`.hud-corner`), giving them an initial silver outline (`rgba(203, 213, 225, 0.5)`) prior to cursor hover interactions.
- Added a permanent crimson drop-shadow glow effect (`text-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(233, 69, 96, 0.5)`) to the interactive footer captions during active mouse hover states.
- **Horizontal Contributor Registry**: Implemented a dedicated flexbox row wrapper layout engine (`.contributors-grid`) to display multi-engineer peer credits side-by-side in a clean, centralized workspace presentation.
- **Micro-Interaction Feedback**: Integrated hardware-accelerated asset response animations (`transform: scale(1.15)`) on the link layers during active mouse cursor hover states.

#### Changed
- Shifted away from unstable, external image-rendering widgets to a clean, lightweight HTML plain-text layout (`.counter-digits`) for maximum stability and asset load performance.
- Configured custom padding logic (`String().padStart(6, '0')`) to preserve a classic, uniform 6-digit layout dashboard profile (`000001`) without relying on blurry pixel-art image files.
- Repositioned the live visitor counter to sit directly underneath the social icons inside the **CONTACT** grid column block to prevent footer text layout crowding.
- Restructured counter container design from a circular capsule to a crisp, glowing square badge profile (`border-radius: 8px`) matching the native dimensions of the contact brand icons.
- Enhanced layout visibility using high-contrast variables: deep-dark container background (`#0f111a`), neon-pink accent outline (`#e94560`), and a sharp glowing green flashing status pulse indicator.
- Redesigned the welcome modal interface from a standard rounded web card to a sharp, zero-radius, matte-finish industrial hardware command block.
- Updated the logo image pointer path from `.jpg` to the matching original `.jpeg` filename to restore instant asset resolution.
- Expanded structural margin spacing between the primary hardware image frame and the typographical content panel (`margin-bottom: 45px !important`) to eliminate element clipping and force clear vertical breathing room.
- Re-engineered the typing loading tagline container with an explicit block layout and strict left-side alignment (`margin-left: 0; text-align: left;`) to anchor character growth perfectly from the left margin without dynamic center shifting.
- Upgraded the text design to a high-contrast dual-tone style, splitting the site title into white and crimson text variations while injecting custom drop-shadow styling highlights (`text-shadow`).
- Replaced the large bottom textual "Close" button block with a sleek, minimalist floating close command icon (`✕`) in the upper-right dashboard frame corner featuring a smooth hover rotation animation transform.
- Upgraded the baseline color of the regional Kannada text script strings (`.emblem-footer-text`) from low-contrast dim gray (`#5f6685`) to full-spectrum crisp white (`#ffffff`) to ensure thin font strokes are completely visible against the dark console backdrop.
- Expanded the physical display canvas dimensions of the tactical emblem graphics (`.emblem-footer-img`) from a restricted `90px × 60px` ratio to an authoritative `110px × 75px` hardware presentation frame.
- Scaled up the upper metadata tag attributes (`::before`) from a cramped `0.6rem` scale to a matching `0.85rem` monospaced layout format while updating its base state color to a high-contrast light silver (`#cbd5e1`).
- Altered the terminal cursor bracket (`.terminal-prefix`) to display a static, un-hidden crimson color state (`#e94560`) by default to enhance instant data tracking before link selection.
- Boosted the primary footer container top padding boundaries from `30px` to `60px` (`padding: 60px 40px 30px 40px !important`) to generate deep vertical separation between main workspace projects and the hardware footer block.
- **Asset Viewport Re-engineering**: Upgraded the asset tracking bounding box to a precise hardware clipping window (`width: 22px; height: 22px; overflow: hidden;`) to isolate structural components from raw asset elements.
- **Typography Alignment Balance**: Standardized row item element tracking gaps down to a strict `4px` layout value inside `.contributor-item` blocks for immediate alignment proximity with the text labels.

#### Fixed
- Fixed critical `ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED` layout-breaking exceptions caused by the completely offline `counter.moe` DNS endpoint.
- Fixed a rendering issue where dynamic third-party script-injected banner widgets threw document exceptions and crashed footer paragraph flex layout constraints during local environment testing (`file:///`).
- Resolved a cache-persistence bug during development by switching to a brand new database namespace string, forcing a pristine and authentic start from `000001` upon production launch.
- Suppressed script-generated promotional tracking URLs using strict structural CSS overrides (`display: none !important`).
- Fixed an overflow layout issue across diverse desktop configurations by expanding container width allowances up to `680px`, ensuring text rows sit locked strictly on a single layout line.
- Resolved a duplicate border overlapping artifact by isolating the sharp single accent border to the logo graphic itself while vaporizing inherited canvas outlines on the parent logo container wrapper.
- Implemented a smart `@media` layout fallback mechanism for tablet and small-screen mobile viewports to prevent narrow layout text clipping on compact, portrait displays.
- Patched a critical text wrap collision bug where enlarged English strings (e.g., `"Gandabherunda Emblem"`) would break onto two rows and directly overlap the top edges of the image container.
- Resolved text crowding constraints by increasing the emblem frame wrapper's bottom margin to `14px` and introducing an explicit `10px` top margin, establishing clean breathing room around the larger typography blocks.
- **Icon Compression Flattening**: Hardened physical rendering dimensions (`min-width`, `max-width`, `min-height`, `max-height`) to completely halt the flexible viewport squeezing and horizontal distortion occurring on the graphics.
- **Asset Text Overflow Padding**: Resolved a deep horizontal phantom gap layout defect by implementing a negative pixel offset shift tracking margin (`margin-left: -58px`), successfully realigning the visible blue logo square flush against the end of the engineer's name strings.
